# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
In this project, we will use AI to develop a system that can automatically detect diabetic  retinopathy in images of the retina. Our system will be trained on a large dataset of images of  the retina, including images with diabetic retinopathy and images without diabetic retinopathy.
