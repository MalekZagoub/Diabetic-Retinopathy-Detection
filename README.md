Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among 
working-aged adults. It is caused by high blood sugar levels, which damage the blood vessels in 
the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Eye Hospitals hopes to detect and 
prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to 
conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospitalâ€™s ability to identify 
potential patients. Currently,The clinics technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images 
and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis.Their goal is 
to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for 
disease and provide information on how severe the condition. 

In this project, we will use AI to develop a system that can automatically detect diabetic 
retinopathy in images of the retina. Our system will be trained on a large dataset of images of 
the retina, including images with diabetic retinopathy and images without diabetic retinopathy. 
Once our system is trained, it will be able to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy in new 
images with a high degree of accuracy.
